The Man from Utah is a 1934 Pre-Code Monogram Western movie starring John Wayne, Polly Ann Young and the stuntman/actor Yakima Canutt. It was written by Lindsley Parsons and directed by Robert N. Bradbury. Wayne has a "singing cowboy scene" in the film, wherein his voice was dubbed.

In the film, an impoverished saddle tramp from Utah, John Weston, rides into a small town seeking work. He finds himself gunning down a trio of men robbing a local bank. 

The marshal sees the fearless, quick-drawing, sharp-shooting, hard-riding stranger as the man for the marshal's plan of discovering who is behind a crooked rodeo. A further mystery is that several rodeo riders have died of snakebite. Weston enters the rodeo as part of a plan to uncover the crooks. He manages to win every event he enters while also solving the crime, including the snakebite mystery, and winning the affection of the local judge's daughter.
