Meet John Doe is a 1941 American comedy-drama film directed and produced by Frank Capra, and starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. 

The film is about a "grassroots" political campaign created unwittingly by a newspaper columnist with the involvement of a hired homeless man and pursued by the paper's wealthy owner.

It became a box office hit and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story. It was ranked #49 in AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers. 

In 1969, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.
